1. On your Smart Phone keypad, the alphabets are mapped to digits as follows: ABC(2),
DEF(3), GHI(4), JKL(5), MNO(6), PQRS(7), TUV(8), WXYZ(9). Write a program called
SmartPhoneKeyPad, which prompts user for a String (case insensitive), and converts to a
sequence of Keypad digits. Use a nested-if (or switchcase) in this exercise. Modify your
program to use an array for table look-up later.
Hints: You can use in.next(),.toLowerCase() to read a string and convert it to lowercase
to reduce your cases.
2. Write a program to find whether given string is palindrome or not.Write a Java program
that converts an English word into PigLatin. To do that there are three rules: if the word
starts with a vowel add way to the end, ex. apple=appleway. If the word has a vowel
but doesn't start with it then take the consonants it front of the first vowel and put the
to the end of the word and add ay to the end. ex: ball=allbay, strong=ongstray. And if
the word has no vowels just add ay to the end. ex. pfft=pfftay. Suppose the string is
“Proud to be an FETian” then its corresponding piglatin string is “Oudpray otay ebay
anway ETianfay”. (piglatin translator is available in
http://www.snowcrest.net/donnelly/piglatin.html).
3. Write and test a method to print all the factorial numbers upto an input limit: (for e.g if
the input is 6, your program should print 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720).
4. Write and test a method int sum_digit(int n, int k). This method returns the
sum of k digit of the positive integer n. For e.g., if n is the positive integer 56789,
then call sum_digit(n,0) would return 9, and the call sum_digit(n,2) will
return 24.
5. Write and test a method to check that a given digit is present in a given number or not.
